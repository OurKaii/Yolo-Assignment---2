# You Only Look Once 
AI 4104 course Assignment - 2 : 
Modify the Yolo model trained on the coco dataset to detect people 
Person Detection from Image using YOLO

This project implements the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm to detect and locate a person in an image. The model identifies human presence and draws bounding boxes around detected individuals along with confidence scores.

what is Yolo - 
YOLO is a deep learning-based object detection algorithm that processes the entire image in a single forward pass through a neural network. It predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously, making it fast and efficient for real-time applications.

Project Objective - 
The objective of this assignment is to:
Understand how YOLO performs object detection
Detect a person from a given image
Visualize the detection results using bounding boxes

Technologies Used -
Python
OpenCV
YOLO (Pre-trained Model)
NumPy
